So far, strong progress has been made in both the Lex and Yacc files. The **syntax analyzer (YACC)** now includes all essential token declarations, operator precedence rules, and a functional start production that logs output properly. The **lexical analyzer (LEX)** features well-defined patterns for whitespace, newline tracking, identifiers, integers, and floating-point numbers, along with correctly implemented keyword recognition and consistent logging for each token. The files are synchronized, compiling smoothly, and following good compiler design principles.
